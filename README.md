## 🚀 About Me

I’m Md. Mujahid Islam, a Senior Software Engineer at United Finance PLC with over 9 years of experience in software engineering. I specialize in developing scalable native, cross-platform, and enterprise-grade applications using Flutter (Dart), Android (Java), iOS (SwiftUI), ASP.NET (C#), Oracle (PL/SQL), and MS SQL Server. I emphasize clean architecture principles (SOLID, MVC, MVP, MVVM), high performance, and robust system design to deliver efficient and maintainable software solutions.

## 🔥 Projects

### 📱 [Weather App (Flutter)](https://github.com/mbiplobe/weather_in_mvvm_flutter)
The Weather Forecaster application has been designed to provide users with the latest weather updates. I am serving as the Lead Developer for this project, responsible for overseeing the development of the application. The application is being developed using Flutter and follows the MVVM architectural pattern to ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficient code management.

> 🛠 Flutter • Provider • MVVM • Geolocator • Open Weather API

### 📦 [Flutter News App](https://github.com/mbiplobe/flutter_news_app.git)
This Flutter News Application is developed using the MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) architecture, the Repository Pattern, and Riverpod for state management. It features a Home Page displaying the latest news from NewsAPI.org, a Category Page for browsing topics such as Technology, Entertainment, Sports, Health, and Business, and a responsive, cross-platform UI with smooth gestures and elegant animations. The architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns, with the Repository layer handling data access and API integration, ViewModels managing state and business logic via Riverpod, and Views dedicated to rendering the user interface. Leveraging Riverpod provides robust state management, streamlined dependency injection, enhanced testability, and scalability. The application is built with Flutter, uses Dio/HTTP for networking, and is structured to support maintainable and extensible development.

### 🧾 [Health Care Mobile Apps (Flutter MVVM)](https://github.com/mbiplobe/flutter_healthcare_app)
This application provides healthcare-related services, originally forked from the Healthcare Mobile App but extensively redesigned and restructured. Migrated from a basic Model-View (MV) to a robust Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, it ensures better separation of concerns, improved testability, and easier maintenance. Built with Flutter, the project focuses on delivering a modern, efficient, and scalable healthcare platform with flexibility for future growth.
